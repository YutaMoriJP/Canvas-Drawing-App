Does canvasRef.current.getContext() need to be stored in a ref or state? Re-rendering may cause the object to be re-created?

canvas.width

nativeEvent.clientX vs event.clientX?

add download feature and add storage option?
- storage option - onMouseUp - toggle stored option (this is when useLocalStorage should be called, so the deps value)
